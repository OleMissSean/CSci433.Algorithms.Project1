# CSci433.Algorithms.Project1
Project 1 in Algorithms. Implement DFS and BFS.

CSci_433 (Spring 15): Analysis of Algorithms
Project 1
Due: Friday, Feb. 20

This project has two parts.

**In the first part, you need to implement DFS in JAVA. Your program should take as input a graph adjacency matrix, and generate the following:

-Order in which vertices are first encountered. Assume that the vertices are visited in numerical order when no other is specified by the search.
-Order in which vertices become dead-ends.
-The number of connected components in the graph.
-Tree edges.
-Back edges.

**In the second part of the project, you need to implement BFS in JAVA. Your program should take as input a graph adjacency matrix as in DFS, and generate the following:

-Order in which vertices are first encountered. Assume that the vertices are visited in numerical order when no other order is specified by the search.
-The number of connected components in the graph.
-Tree edges.
-Cross edges.
